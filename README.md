# ColorLocationTester
WIP
Project will try to use a single invisible ImageView to distribute other views on APP launch.
The invisible ImageView will contain colored fields which the app will find and from there set the coordinates on the other views.
The ImageView can also then be used to assigned onClick behaviour for other views.

If this can work, you would not have to set up a different ui for each different screensize and screen orientation, as the invisiible ImageView will be the same size as the parent, and the views, will scale and position themself automaticly to it.

The roadblock I'm at now is figuring a function that will outline the color when finding the correct color.

You're welcome to help or comment on the project. I'm still a coding novice, and I'm working on this ocationally.
